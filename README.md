I am using C# to creating an application that allows two-players to play a game of Tic-Tac-Toe in the console.

_____

## Example
<!-- Show them what looks like and how how to use the application.  -->

## Architecture
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

I will use Visual Studio to write my code, using C# as the language, and .NET 5.0 as the runtime.
